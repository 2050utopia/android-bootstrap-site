        h4 Why was this developed? 
        p To help get new Android applications off the ground quickly with minimal effort. To get an application built with this toolset could easily take 1-3 weeks with debugging, hacking and experience level. Android Bootsrap and its app generator eliminate this work.
    div.span4 
        h4 What does app generation do?
        p The app generation process does a brute force replace through the android-bootstrap source code and replaces build artifact names, package names and imports. It also generates the proper file structure for your package and updates account manager settings as well as build settings.
    div.span4
        h4 Why should I generate my app? 
        p Because its AWEEEESSSOMMMMMEEEE!!!!! No, really, it is. Using the generator you can shave weeks of development, debugging and rid yourself of the continual face-palming that occurs during the highly error prone manual renaming process.
